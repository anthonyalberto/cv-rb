      normal_explanation: Using the Rails console below, you'll be able to view all the sections of my Resume (and related pictures of my cats!). I suggest following the instructions in the console to view each sections in nicely formatted modal boxes.
      god_explanation: "If you're not familiar with Ruby, no worries, I got you covered! Activate the cheat menu! Like in every game though, there's a trick to activate cheats. Here, enter the Konami code to make it pop! ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → b a"
      ruby_geek_explanation: "Finally, You can also follow the \"Geek way\" by using the Model Schema provided and viewing every ActiveRecord object in the console. I'm automatically passing objects to a function that pretty-prints them so don't call puts/print etc ... Also worth noting, please don't try to break the server. It's pretty easy if you know what you're doing, but I'd have to redeploy the app! Thanks <3"
